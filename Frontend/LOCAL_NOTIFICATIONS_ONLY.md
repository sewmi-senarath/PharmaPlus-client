# 🔔 Using LOCAL Notifications Only

## ✅ What We're Using

This app uses **LOCAL NOTIFICATIONS** scheduled on the device, **NOT remote push notifications**.

### What's the Difference?

| Feature              | LOCAL Notifications (✅ We use this) | Remote Push (❌ Not used) |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Where scheduled**  | On your device                       | From a server             |
| **Needs internet**   | No                                   | Yes                       |
| **Works in Expo Go** | ✅ YES                               | ❌ NO (SDK 53+)           |
| **Needs backend**    | No                                   | Yes (push service)        |
| **Best for**         | Scheduled reminders                  | Real-time messages        |

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. **Permission Request**

```typescript
requestLocalNotificationPermissions();
```

- Asks user for notification permissions
- Sets up Android notification channel
- **NO push token registration** (that's what causes the error!)

### 2. **Scheduling Notification**

```typescript
Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: { ... },
  trigger: {
    type: Notifications.SchedulableTriggerInputTypes.DAILY,
    hour: 8,
    minute: 0,
  }
})
```

- Stored locally on device
- Triggers at specified time
- Repeats daily automatically

### 3. **Canceling Notification**

```typescript
Notifications.cancelScheduledNotificationAsync(notificationId);
```

- Removes scheduled notification from device

## 🚫 What We DON'T Do

We **DO NOT**:

- ❌ Register for push tokens
- ❌ Call `getExpoPushTokenAsync()`
- ❌ Send notifications from a server
- ❌ Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- ❌ Use Apple Push Notification Service (APNS)

## 📱 Why This Works in Expo Go

Expo Go removed **remote push notifications** in SDK 53+, but **local notifications still work perfectly**!

### What Was Removed from Expo Go:

- Remote push notification tokens
- Server-to-device messaging
- `expo-notifications` remote features

### What Still Works in Expo Go:

- ✅ Local scheduled notifications
- ✅ Daily/weekly/monthly triggers
- ✅ Sound, vibration, badges
- ✅ Notification permissions
- ✅ All features we need!

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Button (Bell Icon)

```typescript
testNotification();
```

- Schedules a **local** notification in 2 seconds
- Proves notifications work without remote push

### Verify Button (List Icon)

```typescript
Notifications.getAllScheduledNotificationsAsync();
```

- Shows all **local** notifications scheduled on device
- Useful for debugging

## 📝 Code Comments

All functions now have clear comments:

```typescript
// Configure LOCAL notifications (not remote push notifications)
// Request permission for LOCAL notifications only (no remote push notifications)
// Schedule LOCAL notification (not remote push) - works in Expo Go!
// Cancel a LOCAL notification
// Test LOCAL notification (works in Expo Go!)
```

## 🎉 Benefits

✅ **No development build needed** - works in Expo Go  
✅ **No backend server needed** - notifications scheduled locally  
✅ **Works offline** - doesn't need internet  
✅ **Faster** - no server round-trip  
✅ **More reliable** - device controls the schedule  
✅ **Battery friendly** - OS handles scheduling efficiently

## 🔍 If You See the Warning

The warning about "remote notifications functionality provided by expo-notifications was removed" is **EXPECTED** and **HARMLESS**.

We're not trying to use remote push notifications, so this warning doesn't affect us at all!

### The Warning Says:

> "Android Push notifications (remote notifications) functionality provided by expo-notifications was removed from Expo Go"

### What It Means:

- You can't use **remote** push notifications in Expo Go
- You CAN still use **local** notifications (which we do!)

### How to Confirm:

1. Tap the **Test** button
2. Wait 2 seconds
3. See the notification appear ✅
4. That's a LOCAL notification working perfectly!

- [Development Builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/) (only needed for remote push)

---

**TL;DR**: We use LOCAL notifications (scheduled on device), not remote push notifications (from server). This works perfectly in Expo Go! The warning is expected and harmless. 🎉
