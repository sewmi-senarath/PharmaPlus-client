# Combined Login & Role Selection - Changes Summary

## ✅ What Was Changed

### 1. **Login Screen (login.tsx)**

- **Combined role selection with login** - Users now select their role and login on the same page
- **Removed dependency on roleselection screen** - No need for separate navigation
- **Added inline role selector** - 4 compact role cards (Customer, Pharmacist, Rider, Admin) at the top
- **Visual feedback** - Selected role is highlighted with checkmark
- **Improved error handling** - Better error messages from backend

### 2. **Onboarding Screen (onboarding.tsx)**

- **Updated navigation** - Now directs to `/screens/login` instead of `/screens/roleselection`
- **Streamlined flow** - Users go directly to combined login page after onboarding

### 3. **Role-Based Navigation**

After successful login, users are directed to their appropriate dashboard:

#### **Customer** → `/home` (Customer Dashboard)

- Access to: Home, Search, Orders, Medications, Payment, Profile
- Emergency services available
- Medical information tracking
- Order management

#### **Pharmacist** → `/home` (Pharmacist Dashboard)

- Same dashboard as Customer but with Pharmacist role
- Can be customized to show pharmacy-specific features

#### **Rider** → `/screens/rider-dashboard`

- Dedicated rider dashboard
- Delivery management
- Route tracking
- Earnings overview

#### **Admin** → `/home` (Admin Dashboard with full privileges)

- Full access to all features
- Can switch between different views
- System management capabilities

```
Splash Screen (3s)
    ↓
Onboarding (2.png → 3.png → 4.png → 5.png)
    ↓ (Skip or Complete)
Login Page (with role selector)
    ↓
[Based on selected role]
    ├─ Customer → Customer Dashboard
    ├─ Pharmacist → Pharmacist Dashboard
    ├─ Rider → Rider Dashboard
    └─ Admin → Admin Dashboard (full access)
```

### Backend Integration

- Role is sent to backend: `/api/users/login`
- Request body includes:
  ```json
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "role": "customer" (lowercase)
  }
  ```
- Response saved to AsyncStorage:
  - `authToken` - Access token
  - `refreshToken` - Refresh token
  - `userRole` - Selected role

## 📱 How to Use

### For Users:

1. **Launch app** - See splash screen
2. **View onboarding** - Skip or go through all screens
3. **Select role** - Tap on Customer, Pharmacist, Rider, or Admin
4. **Enter credentials** - Email and password
5. **Login** - Automatically routed to correct dashboard

### For Developers:

The role selection is now embedded in the login screen:

```tsx
// Selected role is stored in state
const [selectedRole, setSelectedRole] = useState<string>("Customer");

// Sent to backend during login
const response = await authService.login(email, password, selectedRole);

// Navigation based on role
switch (selectedRole) {
  case "Customer":
  case "Pharmacist":
  case "Admin":
    router.replace("/home", { params: { userRole } });
    break;
  case "Rider":
    router.replace("/screens/rider-dashboard");
    break;
}
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

- **Role is validated on backend** - Frontend role selection is just UI
- **Tokens are properly stored** - Using AsyncStorage
- **Role-based access control** - Each dashboard checks user role
- **Admin has full access** - Can access any page/feature

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

1. **Single Page Login** - No back and forth between screens
2. **Visual Role Selection** - Clear icons and labels
3. **Responsive Design** - Works on all screen sizes
4. **Loading States** - Shows "Logging in..." during request
5. **Error Messages** - Clear, user-friendly error display
6. **Smooth Navigation** - No jarring transitions

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements:

1. **Role-specific features** in home dashboard
2. **Admin panel** with user management
3. **Pharmacist inventory** management
4. **Rider earnings** tracking
5. **Analytics dashboard** for Admin

### Optional:

- Keep old roleselection screen for direct access
- Add "Remember me" checkbox
- Implement biometric login
- Add 2FA for Admin role

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Role not being sent to backend

**Solution:** Check `authService.ts` - make sure role parameter is included in POST request

**Solution:** Verify `userRole` is saved in AsyncStorage and check switch statement in handleLogin

### Issue: Can't select role

**Solution:** Check if roles array is properly mapped and onPress handlers are working
